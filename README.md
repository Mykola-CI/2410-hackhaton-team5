# Track My Job

An user-friendly application that helps users efficiently manage and track their job applications. Applying for jobs across multiple platforms can quickly become overwhelming, making it difficult to monitor each application's status. With Track My Job, users can easily keep track of all their job applications in one place. The app provides visual insights, such as pie charts, to display application statistics, helping users evaluate and adjust their job search strategies as needed.<br>

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette](docs/colours.png)

#F2EBE1 (Off-white) – Great for background elements, keeping things clean and minimal.<br>
#305F6D (Teal) – Ideal for headers, highlights, or icons to bring focus and contrast.<br>
#BF6E15 (Orange) – This strong accent color could be used for buttons, call-to-actions, or important highlights to draw attention.<br>
#C1884E (Light Brown) – A softer tone that would pair well with the orange, maybe for secondary buttons or text.<br>
#698C8E (Muted Blue) – A calming color that would work great for less prominent text, borders, or nav/ footer sections.

This palette balances warm and cool tones, making the app feel both welcoming and trustworthy

### Typography

Poppins from Google Fonts was chosen to ensure the text is easy to read. Its letterforms are nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary, maintaining an even typographic color.

### Features

All pages feature a fully responsive navbar that transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.<br>
